      <p>
        Seattle is home to Starbucks, the most well known coffee industry in the world. Pretty much every corner you
        turn, there is a coffee shop. As much as it’s common and vital to many, there is more to coffee than just a
        deliciously brewed drink. From the farmers that grew the coffee beans, factory workers that process them,
        drivers that transport to the very barista that made your drink, the labor of thousands go into producing one
        cup of coffee. Coffee production also has a major environmental impact in deforestation, water pollution and GHG
        emissions. To explore this issue further, our group decided to explore the following question: “Does your coffee
        shop ethically source its coffee beans?”
      </p>

        Ethically sourced coffee means providing transparency and traceability of products. According to Dublin
        Roasters, an ethically sourced coffee brand, these regulations are intended to improve “not only the environment
        but the living conditions of small farmers who produce them” (<a href="https://dublinroasterscoffee.com/what-is-ethically-sourced-coffee/#:~:text=This%20means%20keeping%20an%20eye,small%20farmers%20who%20produce%20them" target="_blank">Dublin Roasters</a>, 2022). Like many industries, laborers are often exploited under unfair conditions. Ethical sourcing is important because it would ensure that farmers and laborers are compensated fairly for their work and combat the environmental effect coffee has. Existing solutions like ethically sourced coffee brands <a href="https://mtpak.coffee/2022/01/roasters-guide-ethically-sourced-coffee/" target="_blank">MTPAK Coffee</a> or <a href="https://dublinroasterscoffee.com/what-is-ethically-sourced-coffee/#:~:text=This%20means%20keeping%20an%20eye,small%20farmers%20who%20produce%20them" target="_blank">Dublin Roasters</a> have informational blog posts that educate consumers on what ethical coffee is, the importance, etc. <a href="https://www.fairtradeamerica.org/shop-fairtrade/fairtrade-products/coffee/" target="_blank">FAIR TRADE America</a>, a sticker used to indicate fairtrade products also provides informational articles to educate consumers. After learning about these things, consumers are more likely to take action against unethical products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite how common coffee is, not many people are aware of the importance of ethical sourcing or even know what
        fair trade products are. By creating an interactive web app that educates and shows consumers if their local
        coffee shop uses ethically sourced beans, we aim to raise awareness in sustainable and equitable coffee
        production practices. This initiative will not only foster a deeper appreciation for the coffee industry, but
        also contribute to better lives of coffee farmers and their communities worldwide.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <!-- Athena's work -->
      <p>
        The application’s user base primarily consists of coffee enthusiasts who care for sustainability and the ethical
        sourcing of coffee beans. These individuals are keen on discovering and experiencing diverse offerings from
        local coffee establishments, driven by their discerning taste preferences. Nonetheless, a significant portion of
        this demographic face challenges in discerning whether the coffee beans used by these establishments align with
        their ethical standards. This application has been designed to offer features that empower users to make
        informed decisions as they explore these coffee shops. These features encompass the ability to access
        information about the origins and ethical production practices associated with coffee beans, identify nearby
        coffee shops that adhere to ethical sourcing standards, engage in a coffee quiz to suggest suitable coffee
        varieties to users, and encourage user participation by enabling them to contribute their unique coffee drink
        creations.

        The users of the coffee website will have access to a comprehensive range of information related to coffee. This
        includes details about various types of coffee, their origins, and flavor profiles. Information on which coffee
        suits their preferences best will also be available. However, the website's primary focus is on ethical sourcing
        and sustainability. Users can learn about the importance of ethically sourced coffee and discover nearby coffee
        shops that support these practices. Furthermore, for those feeling adventurous, there will be an option to
        submit and explore other users' coffee orders for new experiences. To provide accurate and up-to-date
        information, we intend to research what coffee beans different coffee shops use, and if they are fairtrade
        coffee or ethically sourced coffee.

        Our app will help users solve if their coffee shops are ethically sourcing their beans by teaching what it means
        for beans to be ethically sourced. Users can learn what to look for as evidence for the sourcing and whether
        their favorite coffee shops meet the standards. Our app will also be helpful since it is accessible, will list
        what coffee shops are proven to have ethically sourced beans, provide a quiz to help any indecisive coffee drinkers choose their drink of the day, and users can also enjoy their love for coffee by sharing their custom drinks with the others to try.
