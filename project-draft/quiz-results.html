<!-- this is a temporary to take notes for the last page of the quiz feature -->
<!-- 
Features needed:
CSS and HTML
- Same background color (mint)
- Same footer with the brown bar so it isn't light font against light background (do the same thing that is in quiz.js)
- Keep title in same position (just change it to Quiz Results)
- Have same format as tracker and explore page for position of cards
- Get the scroll class
- Maybe add a filter to reorganize the cards?
