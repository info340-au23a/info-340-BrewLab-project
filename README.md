# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

BrewLab is a coffee social media platform, aimed to create a community for all levels of coffee enthusiasts who want to connect with others within the community. This initiative will not only foster the culture of customization and serve as a platform for individuals to share their passion for coffee and unique coffee traditions, but also provide valuable insights for coffee businesses to improve upon their products and services. This website provides a community where people can share drinks they've had or recipes of drinks they have made. Alongside the quiz, this empowers users to discover the coffee and coffee drinks that best align with their preferences. For the more adventurous coffee lovers, the option to share, review and save customized coffee orders adds a touch of excitement.
